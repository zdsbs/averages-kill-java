==
Worker profile per tier?
If the simulation goes to long do we need a timeout?

Randomize
workers-completion: 
	distribution: normal, uniform, etc
	mean: 10
	stdv: 0

transition-time: 
	distribution: normal
	mean: 1
	stdv: 0

TODO:
Build dummy simulation that stubs out the results
Can I build it using the pieces I have
